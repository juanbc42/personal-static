### [Coca-Cola]({{< ref "stories/coca-cola.md" >}})

I've worked in CI&T for the Coca-Cola, and I've worked directly with the Atlanta Based client.
The job was about to help markets around the world to change the content, by using an Adobe CMS: Adobe Experience Manager. 

### [Coca-Cola Frontend]({{< ref "stories/coca-cola-front.md" >}})

When in Coca-Cola I've also had the opportunity to work with Front-end in the CMS, however for the USA Market instead of the Global Market.
